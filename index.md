I'm **Pablo Estefó**, a PhD Student in [Computer Science](http://dcc.uchile.cl) from [Faculty of Physics and Mathematics](http://ingenieria.uchile.cl/) of the [University of Chile](http://www.uchile.cl).
I'm also a member of [RyCh](https://rych.dcc.uchile.cl/) research group.

I obtained my bachelor's degree at Universidad de Chile in 2011.
In parallel I worked on the project [*Refactoring Unit Tests with TestSurgeon*](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6227219/) under the supervision of the Prof. Dr. [Alexandre Bergel](http://bergel.eu). This work not only allowed me to obtain my professional degree (Computer Science Engineer), but also got the [1st place in the ACM Student Research Competition (Undergrad Category)](http://src.acm.org/winners/2013) in the [34th International Conference on Software Engineer (ICSE)](https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/icseweb/) held in Zürich, Switzerland.

My first approximation to software engineering for robotics was in 2014 in a 6-months internship at the [Components, Agents, and Robots with Dynamic Languages](http://car.mines-douai.fr/) lab of the [École des Mines de Douai](http://swww..mines-douai.fr) in the north of France. There I worked in projects involved in exercising demos with the Robulab robot using the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://ros.org) and [PhaROS](http://car.mines-douai.fr/category/software/pharos/) a [Pharo Smalltalk](http://pharo.org) binding for ROS. I was under supervision of Prof. Dr. [Noury Bouraqadi](http://car.mines-douai.fr/noury/) and Prof. Dr. [Luc Fabresse](http://car.mines-douai.fr/luc/).

Back in Chile and after obtaining the scholarship from [CONICYT](http://www.conicyt.cl), I started my PhD in Computer Science under supervision of Prof. Dr. [Johan Fabry](https://pleiad.cl/people/jfabry) and Prof. Dr. [Romain Robbes](https://www.inf.unibz.it/~rrobbes/) as my co-advisor. I became the administrator of the [PR2 robot](http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/pr2/overview) and worked mainly on [code duplication of ROS artifacts](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7416575/).
After Prof. Fabry left the academy, the Prof. Dr. [Jocelyn Simmonds](https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~jsimmond/) became my advisor. Nowadays I'm working on my Thesis Proposal which cover topics related to the software reuse in the ROS community.
